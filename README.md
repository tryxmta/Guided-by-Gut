## Introduction

In the world of AI, reasoning is key. **Guided by Gut** aims to improve the way LLMs reason about data. By focusing on intrinsic confidence and novelty, we provide a framework that enhances performance while being efficient. This approach allows models to make better decisions and improve their output quality.

## Features

- **Self-Guided TTS**: Use our framework to implement TTS that adapts based on confidence levels.
- **RL-Calibrated**: Leverage reinforcement learning to fine-tune model responses.
- **Efficient Computation**: Optimize inference time while maintaining high accuracy.
- **Novelty Detection**: Identify new patterns in data to enhance learning.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to set up and use, even for those new to machine learning.

## Installation

To get started with **Guided by Gut**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tryxmta/Guided-by-Gut.git
   cd Guided-by-Gut
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up. You can use virtual environments to manage dependencies effectively.

## Usage

After installation, you can begin using **Guided by Gut**. Here's a simple example:

```python
from guided_by_gut import GuidedTTS

model = GuidedTTS()
model.train(data)
output = model.generate_speech(text)
```

Replace `data` and `text` with your own inputs. This example shows how easy it is to get started.

## How It Works

**Guided by Gut** operates on several key principles:

1. **Intrinsic Confidence**: The model evaluates its own confidence in the predictions it makes. This self-assessment helps in making informed decisions.

2. **Novelty Detection**: The system identifies new and unique patterns in data. This capability allows the model to adapt and learn continuously.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: By using RL techniques, the model fine-tunes its responses based on feedback, leading to improved performance over time.

4. **Efficient Computation**: We focus on minimizing the computational load during inference. This allows the model to operate quickly without sacrificing accuracy.
